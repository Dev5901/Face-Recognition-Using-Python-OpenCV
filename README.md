# Face Recognition Using Python OpenCV
 The idea of this project is to build a program which can  recognize the face of an individual from a user entered video. The goal of  this project is to simplify the working of the police department as this  system will speed up their process of identifying a criminal’s face in a crime video.
 
It is based on face detection and face recognition processes. Face detection locates a face in a given video and separates it from the remaining scene. In our project, we develop a face recognition system able to detect and recognize the face in the video. The application will detect faces in each frame of video, apply some image processing techniques, perform face recognition of the person’s image present in the criminal database
